*Hi Angel,*

*You have decided to enroll in an amazing travel across the __Front-End Web Developer ND__, a great decision!. Please take into account it will be hard, and I'm sure you'll get stuck. Both issues are normal when someone decides to take the control of his/her life by performing some deep changes in its direction. Anyway, I know you are strong enough to overcome all the possible upcoming troubles, just trust in the force, your mind's force, it will guide you!*

*When you fall into problems and feel stuck and like giving up, just breath and stop working in that recursive problem! Take a break, put your trainers on and go out to run a couple of miles. I'm sure your mind will disconnect from that problematic task, the next time you open your notebook the solution will appear. __Your mind is your biggest weapon__ to solve problems, and sometimes it just needs some time to do it*

*Always think there are no problems big enough to get you stuck for a long time, think all problems can be split into smaller ones. __Divide to rule!__ This always works.*

*Please try to learn as much as possible, every lesson, every reviewer's comment, and every post in the forums will help you to overcome the new problems that for sure will appear! __Google and StackOverflow__ are amazing information resources.*

*Lastly, enjoy! Enjoy every second of this travel with enthusiasm, because after all, __life__, in every of its aspects, is to __enjoy and have fun!__*

*Happy learning and be Udacious,*

*Angel*
