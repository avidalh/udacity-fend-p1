*Hi,*

*You have decided to enroll in a great and amazing travel across the Front-End Web Developer. Please take into account it will be hard and I'm sure you'll get stuck, both things are normal when someone decides to take the control of his/her live by performing some deep changes in its direction. Anyway, you are strong enough to overcome all the possible upcoming troubles, just trust in the force, your mind's force, it will guide you!*

*When you fall into problems and feel stuck and like giving up, just breath and stop working in that recursive problem! Take a break, go out and run a couple of miles, I'm sure your mind will disconnect from the problematic task, the next time you open your notebook the solution will appear. Your mind is your biggest weapon to solve problems!*

*Always think there are no big problem enough to get you stuck, think all problems can be split into little problems. Divide to rule! This always works.*

*Please try to learn as much as possible, every lesson, every reviewer comment, and every post in the forums will help you to overcome solve the new problems that will appear!*

*Lastly, enjoy! Enjoy every second of this travel with enthusiasm, because after all, life, in every of its aspects, is to enjoy and have fun!*

*Happy learning and be Udacious,*

*Angel*
